The Blessings of the Torah were never taken away. People will argue about curses, scapegoats, and trees, and that's OK, because it's very important, but I want to speak about something we can all agree about: blessings. Even to the one who believes he doesn't have to keep the Torah, you can still show him how he will gain a blessing for doing so. The reason is because doing so gives YHVH a good Name, and it is the Name of YHVH that blesses, as it is written, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of YHVH." -Ps. 118:26a, and now for Ps. 129.8b: “The blessing of Yehovah be on you; we bless you in the name of Yehovah." Again, "Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters "Yehovah be with you." "Yehovah bless you," they replied." (Ruth 2:4). Of course, this is also a great time to point out that the Name of Yehovah was used in this special way. Boaz had this exchange with the laborers in his own harvest. In fact, in the instance, he was, "the lord of the harvest" (note small l lord). You see, a blessing is not to be spoken upon just anyone, as Ps. 129:5,8 teaches us: "Let all those who hate Tsiyon be put to shame and turned back...And those who pass by shall not say, “The blessing of יהוה be upon you; We have blessed you in the Name of יהוה!” Why those who hate Tsiyon? Because those who hate Tsiyon hate the Law, since Tsiyon is the centerpiece of how the Law is to be carried out religiously and judicially, according to the Torah and Prophets, and it is where the House and Presence of YHVH would abide, as it it written, "We shall bless you from the House of יהוה." This is why the Torah goes forth from Tsiyon: 

<br><br> Micah 4:1-2:"But at the end of days <br>
the mountain of Yehovah's House will be established as chief of the mountains, <br>
and will be raised above the hills. <br>
Peoples will flow up to it. <br>
2 Then many nations will go and say: <br>
“Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yehovah, <br>
    to the House of the Eloah of Ya'aqov! <br>
Then He will direct us in His ways, <br>
    and we will walk in His paths.” <br>
For Torah will go forth from Tsion, <br>
and the word of Yehovah from Jerusalem."  <br><br>

Interestingly enough, when we don't keep the Torah as a people, the Temple is not standing, and the blessings have been diminished. Historically, when we keep the Torah as a people, the Temple is built and the blessings flow. Thankfully, there is a Temple in the Shamayim and we have a role in building it here on earth. Shalom in the Truth. And to all those who obey the Truth, YHVH bless you.
