Matthew 7:22-26: 
<br> <br>
Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’ 
<br> <br>
Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’ 
<br> <br>
Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.  
<br> <br>           
The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock. 
<br><br>
But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.…"
<br><br>
So, this is a Biblical view of salvation. Hear and do = salvation. Hear and don't do = fall (that's what happens to the house build on the sand). 
<br><br>
But what does it mean to hear and do, or not do?
<br><br>
Matt. 25:31-46 gives us another clear answer about acting on the words of Messiah, which are God's Words: 
<br><br>

“And when the Son of Aḏam comes in His esteem, and all the set-apart messengers with Him, then He shall sit on the throne of His esteem.
<br><br>
“And all the nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats.
<br><br>
“And He shall set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.
<br><br>
“Then the Sovereign shall say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the reign prepared for you from the foundation of the world –
<br><br>
for I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink, I was a stranger and you took Me in,
<br><br>
was naked and you clothed Me, I was sick and you visited Me, I was in prison and you came to Me.’
<br><br>
“Then the righteous shall answer Him, saying, ‘Master, when did we see You hungry and we fed You, or thirsty and gave You to drink?
<br><br>
‘And when did we see You a stranger and took You in, or naked and clothed You?
<br><br>
‘And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and we came to You?’
<br><br>
40“And the Sovereign shall answer and say to them, ‘Truly, I say to you, in so far as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers, you did it to Me.’
<br><br>
“He shall then also say to those on the left hand, ‘Go away from Me, accursed ones, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his messengers –
<br><br>
for I was hungry and you gave Me no food, I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink,
<br><br>
‘I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, was naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’
<br><br>
“Then they also shall answer Him, saying, ‘Master, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not serve You?’
<br><br>
“Then He shall answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, in so far as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’
<br><br>
“And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into everlasting life.”
<br><br>
Knowing Yeshua is actually having met him in real life: in the friendless, cast out, orphaned, poor, unhappy, imprisoned, lonely, sick, and so on, around you and in this world. Because those were all things that Yeshua went through when he took the curse for mankind's sin upon himself. He knows how if feels to suffer. But there is a relief for your suffering in this salvationi. Heed the Messiah, friends! Do Rightousness and live!
