<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Matthean Primacy</h1>
<p style="font-size: 150%;">
MatitYahu, or Mattai for short, was a follower of Yeshua who was called out of a life of recording the legers of tax documents, to live a life of following that path the rigtheous miracle worker from Galil trod. 
    <br>
    <br>
    He would end up recording the first gospel of the New Testament, the Gospel of Matthew, in the Hebrew language. That this gospel was orignally composed in Hebrew is well-accepted, and this fact is attested by important names in early Christendom such names as Jerome and Eusibius. It is also recorded that the Jewish followers of Yeshua also held this account in high esteem. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Because Matthew records the teachings of Yeshua to his Jewish audience in the most detail, and in the original language, the account has primacy in the New Testament, according to my belief. Not only is it the first book, but I feel strongly that it is the most authoritative book in New Testament. It firmly founds Yeshua's teaching on the Torah. 
  
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Tanakh Primacy</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 150%;">
    However, the oracles of God, i.e. the Torah, Prophets, and all the Writings of the Tanakh (the Old Testament, or Hebrew Bible), are of a higher primacy than even Matthew. This was and is the belief of many of the Notsrim (Jewish follwers of Yeshua). At the time of the apostle Paul writing the book of Romans, they, the Ancient Testaments of the Law and Prophets, were the only known Scripture. The rest, as they say, is commentary. However, accounts and commentaries and responsa (epistles) can also be inpspired by and contain truths expounded from the Torah. They in no means they supercede what comes before. On the contrary, but everything in its due order!
  <br>
  <br>
   <h1> Surviving Hebrew versions.  </h1>
    
    <p style="font-size: 150%;">
    There are three main versions of Hebrew Matthew surviving until this day. They are the Shem Tov, Du Tillet, and Munster texts. These are are their informal names. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The Hebrew texts used here, are initially to be bassed on the Du Tillet text (Heb. 132) with the major Shem Tov variants in braces {}, and Munster variants beween great/less-than signs <>.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fuller translations of each manuscript(s) and parallel readings to come. 
    <br>
      <br>
      With due respect for the name of YHVH and Yeshua, those names have been restored to their original rendering and such corrections are not noted. They are not needed in the case of the naming of Yeshua in Matt. 2. In the Munster text, these corrections are made by Munster himself throughout the text.
