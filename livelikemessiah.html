God's message to mankind is simple: Live a righteous life. Live like Jesus (Yeshua). When we read in Bible translations, "believe in me", the literal meaning of the words are "be persuaded by me." So, if we were to "believe" Yeshua, we would amend our ways to live righteously. Actions were the focus of Yeshua's teaching, so he is talking about actions when he says, "be persuaded by me", i.e., "heed my words." This is also why he could say, "except you be persuaded by me, you shall die in your sin."  The issue is not if someone has or has not mentally affirmed that Jesus is the Messiah, has died for their sins, or is the Son of God, but rather if they've kept his words, which are God's words.

<br> 
Dear friend. Don't let this be you! Learn Messiah's words, the words of God, and live like Messiah!  
<br>  <br>          
Righteous living was also the main focus of the Law and Prophets. Here are some verses I call 'bread and butter' verses:  
<br><br>
Deut. 6:18 "Do what is right and good in the sight of יהוה
<br><br>
Micah 6:8: "He has declared to you, O man, what is good. And what does יהוה require of you but to do right, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?"
<br><br>
Zachariah 7:9-10: “Thus said יהוה of hosts, ‘Execute true justice, do kindness and compassion everyone to his brother. Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the immigrant or the poor. And do not plot evil in your hearts against one another.’"
<br><br>
Isaiah 1:17: "Learn to do right, seek justice, correct the oppressor, defend the fatherless, plead for the widow."
<br><br>
     
Isaiah 1:27: "Zion will be redeemed with justice, her repentant ones with righteousness."
<br><br>
Jeremiah 22:3: ‘Thus said יהוה, “Do justice and righteousness, and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor. Do not maltreat nor do violence to the immigrant, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place."'...
<br><br>
Jeremiah 22:16: "He administered justice and righteousness, and so it went well with him. He took up the cause of the poor and needy, and so it went well. <b>"Is this not what it means to know Me?”</b"> declares יהוה.
