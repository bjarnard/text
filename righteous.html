   <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Righteous</h1>
   <br>
   <p style="font-size: 150%;">
There are two strains of thought concerning righteousness. One assumes that no one is righteous, except Yeshua, while the other assumes that some are, and indeed can be, righteous. The first view is often used to bolster an anti-law view of the gospel: don't even try to be righteous, keep commands, etc. Righteousness in this view is never based on actual actions, but on a righteousness sort of leeched via reverse osmosis from Jesus by a mental affirmation of his status as the Messiah in the flesh, the Son of God, lord, or atoning sacrifice, depending on your theology. This is a by-proxy righteousness that is "inputed" or "accounted" to the believer. 

<br><br>

Gen. 15:6 is said to encapsulate this: "And Avram believed in YHVH, and he reckoned it to him as righteousness." But the Hebrew says he "believed <b>in</b> YHVH" so this is actually about worship of and faith in the one true God, who knows all and does all, declaring the end from the beginning, not the mental affirmation of a particular fact about the Messiah. 

<br><br>

<a href="/text/isjesusgod.html">Is Jesus God?</a>

<br><br>

It should be noted that worshipping the Creator, by faith, and Him alone, is an act of righteousness incumbent upon all humanity. This is why Avraham is the father of Faith to all who believe. Controversially, this was and is faith in YHVH, not Yeshua.  

<br><br>

Verses used to support the view that righteousness is only by faith, not by the works of faith: 

<br><br>

Eccles. 7:20: For there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and does not sin.

<br><br>

[Refutation: This verse simply means that there is no righteous person, who has been conceived and born by a natural birth, that  has not sinned, or never will. Previously, 
Qohelet cautions the theoretically righteous to be humble, using hyperbole. They are not 100 % righteous because they are from below, and are subject to corruption, and they should not think of themselves as righteous and very capable, because to do so is dangerous and could over-extend them in their limited knowledge and capacity: "I have seen it all in my days of futility: There is a righteous one perishing in his righteousness, and there is a wrong one living long in his evil. Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise – why destroy yourself?" (Eccl. 7:15-16). 

<br><br>  

The prophets and authors of the wisdom writings used hyperbole to teach and drive home a point to not think too highly of one's self. They inculcate true righteousness in this way, which is humble righteousness.   

<br><br>

This verse is quoted by Paulos in Matthew 9:9: 
<br><br> 

As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. “Follow Me,” He told him, and Matthew got up and followed Him.

<br><br>

Later, as Jesus was dining at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Him and His disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

<br><br>

On hearing this, Jesus said, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
 
<br><br>

But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

<br><br>

This statement is repeated in Mark 2 and Luke 5:

<br><br>

Mark 2:16-17: 

<br><br>

And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His taught ones, “Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”

<br><br>

And hearing this, יהושע said to them, “Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.”

<br><br>

Luke 5:1-7 pretty much seals the deal: 

<br><br>

"Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming to Him to hear Him.

<br><br>

And the Pharisees and scribes grumbled, saying, “This One receives sinners and eats with them.”

<br><br>

And He spoke this parable to them, saying,

<br><br>

“What man among you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?

<br><br>

“And having found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

<br><br>

“And having come home, he calls together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’

<br><br>

“I say to you that in the same way there shall be more joy in the heaven over one sinner repenting, than over ninety-nine righteous ones who need no repentance."
<br><br>

Now this is a very thorny issue because many a denomination will have you believe that Yeshua was being tricky here, and in other passages, because in reality no one is righteous. While I agree that everyone will have to repent at some point in their lives, making needed changes, these passages are too plain to be tricks, winks, or whatnot. 
<br><br>
Especially in the light on Yeshua's teaching that we are supposed to approach Elohim humbly, not assuming we are righteous, why would Yeshua suggest some are righteous if they weren't?   
<br><br>
Further, Yeshua makes reference to past righteous people: 
<br><br>
Matt. 23:35:
<br><br>
"And so upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar." 
<br><br>
So we can understand that righteousness is a real thing. Those who are practicing it don't need to repent. Quite simply put, the righteousness of these people was not defined by if they believe in Yeshua as the Messiah.

<br><br>

The letter to the Hebrew (11:3) indicates, 

"These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth." 

<br><br> 
Now, the way theologians try to wiggle out of this one will hurt your brain: dispensationalism, i.e. the idea that there are different standards of righteousness for different time periods. In one period you have to do what is right. In another, all you have to do is believe. How does that sound to you? It sounds unfair to me. In fact, it contradicts the clear teachings of Yeshua:   

Matt. 5:17-20 (ISR): 
<br> <br> 
“Do not think that I came to destroy the Torah or the Prophets.a I did not come to destroy but to complete.
<br> <br> 
“For truly, I say to you, till the heaven and the earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall by no means pass from the Torah till all be done.
<br> <br> 
“Whoever, then, breaks one of the least of these commands, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the reign of the heavens; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens.
<br> <br> 
“For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees,a you shall by no means enter into the reign of the heavens.
