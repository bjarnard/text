<div class="grid-item">

In that hour, the taught-ones came near to Yeshua, saying, "who will be great in the Kingdom of Heaven?" </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
 <div class="grid-item">And Yeshua took one young lad, and stood him among them, </div>
    <div class="grid-item"> </div>  
<div class="grid-item">and he said, "confirmed [is what] I say to ye, if ye don't repent, and become like young lads, you will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven. </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
<div class="grid-item">And all who humble themselves like a this young lad, he will be great in the Kingdom of Heaven. </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
<div class="grid-item">And whosoever recieves a young lad like this, in my name, he recieves me. </div>
   <div class="grid-item"> </div>   
<div class="grid-item">But whosoever makes one of these small-ones stumble, that believe me, [it would be] good for him that he have an upper millstone hung around his neck to cast him into the depths of the sea. </div>
   <div class="grid-item"> </div>   
<div class="grid-item"> Woe to the world because of offenses. It's necessary that offenses come, but woe to the man from whom offense comes. </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
<div class="grid-item"> And if your hand or your foot offend you, cut it off, and cast it from you, for [it would be] good for you to enter into life weak or lame, then to be sent with your hands and feet to the eternal fire. </div>
   <div class="grid-item"> </div>   
<div class="grid-item">And if your eye makes you stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you, for [it would be] better to enter with one eye into life, than being sent with two eyes to fire of Gehinnom. </div>
    <div class="grid-item"> </div>  
<div class="grid-item"> See that you don't despise one of these little-ones, for I say to ye, that their angels in Heaven always behold the face of my Father in Heaven, </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
<div class="grid-item"> for the Son of man [comes] to save what was lost. </div>
   <div class="grid-item"> </div>   
<div class="grid-item">How [do] ye see? If a man has one-hundred, and one of them gets lost, will not the man leave [the] ninety-nine of the flock in [the] desert, and go seek her that got lost? </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
    <div class="grid-item">  And if it comes to pass that she is found, Amen I say to ye, that he will rejoice over her more than the ninety-nine others that went not astray. </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
     <div class="grid-item"> Thus [it is] not [the] will of your Father in Heaven for children that one of these small ones gets lost. </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
     <div class="grid-item">And if your brother sins against you, and you rebuke him between you and him alone, and if he hears you, you have gained your brother, </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
    <div class="grid-item">  and if he will not hear you, take you another witness or two, so that at the mouth [of] two or three witnesses every matter will stand. </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
    <div class="grid-item">  And if he does not hear them, say [it] to him in [the] assembly. And if he refuses two hearken in [the] assembly, let [him] be as a non-Jew and master transgressor. </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
  <div class="grid-item">    Amen I say to ye, all that ye bind upon the earth, they will be bound also in Heaven. And all that you loose upon the earth, they will be loosed in Heaven also." </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
    <div class="grid-item">  Further he said ye, "If  two you come [as] one on the earth, of every word they ask will come to pass for them from my Father, He that [is] in Heaven. </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
   <div class="grid-item">  For in every place where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am amongst them. </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
   <div class="grid-item">   Then Kepha called to him, and he said, "I would know how many times one will sin against me, and I will forgive him? Up to sevent times?" </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
    <div class="grid-item">  And Yeshua said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but even up to seventy seven times. </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
   <div class="grid-item">   Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man [who was] a king that wanted to take account of his servants. </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
    <div class="grid-item">  And when he began to take account, one drew near to him that was obliged to give him 10,000 <i>minas</i>, </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
    <div class="grid-item">  and since he had nought [with] to repay him, his Adon commanded to sell him and his wife and his sons, and all that he had until it should come to pass that all that was owe was repayed him. </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
    <div class="grid-item">  And that servant bowed down, and he entreated him, saying, "Wait for me, and I will repay you the whole [sum]." </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
   <div class="grid-item">   And the Adon was favorable to his servant, and let him go and he forgave his debt. </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
   <div class="grid-item">   And this servant went forth, and found one of them who were servants like him, and this [one] was obliged to give him 100 <i>meah</i>. And he took hold of him, and grabbed him, saying, "pay what you are obligated to give me." </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
   <div class="grid-item">   And that servant bowed down and entreated him, saying, "Wait for me, and I will pay you the whole [sum]." </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
    <div class="grid-item">  And he refused, and he went and cast him into the prison house until he would repay all his debt. </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
   <div class="grid-item">   And other servants saw what he did, and they were very pained, and they came and told to their Adon all that he did. </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
    <div class="grid-item">  Then their Adon called him, and said to him, "Worthless servant! Behold, I forgave you all the debt because you entreated me, </div>
     <div class="grid-item"> </div> 
   <div class="grid-item">   should not you also been entreated of a servant like I was entreated of you? </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
   <div class="grid-item">   And his Adon's anger grew intense, and he bound him in the prison house until he should repay all his debt. </div>
      <div class="grid-item"> </div>
