          <div id="showspace">10 and behold, a man whose hand was withered, and they asked him, saying, “is it permissible to heal the sick on Shabbat?” And this entire fabric[ated question] was simply [designed to give them a reason] to snitch on him to the Courthouse.
            <br><br>
            
            11 And he said to them, “who among ye, [being] a man that has one of sheep that falls in a pit on Shabbat, and will not take hold of her, and bring her up?
            <br><br>
            
            12 Is not man better than the sheep? Therefore, it is permissible to do good [deeds] on Shabbat.”
            
            <br><br>
            13 Then he said to [the] man, “put forth your hand.” And he put [it] forth and it was restored to health like the other one.
            <br><br>
            
            14 And the Pirushim went forth and bore witness against him with the purpose of destroying him.
            <br><br>
            
            15 And Yeshua knew, and turned from there, and many walked behind him, and he healed them all.
            <br><br>
            
            16 And he commanded them that they not publish it abroad,
            <br><br>
            
            17 so that what was said at the hand of YeshiYahu the prophet would be established—the saying,
            <br><br>
            
            18 ‘behold my servant. I will uphold him [who is] my chosen, the pleasure of my soul. I have put My Spirit upon him. He shall bring forth right-ruling to the nations.
            
            <br><br>
            19 He shall not cry out, and neither will he lift up [a shout], nor make his voice heard in the street.
            
            <br><br>
            20 He will not break a crushed reed, and will not extinguish a dim [wick of] flax until he place right-ruling in [the] land.
            
            <br><br>
            21 And the islands shall wait for his Torah.’
            <br><br>
            
            22 Then drew near one mastered by demons, [who was] blind and deaf, and he healed him so that he was able to speak.
            <br><br>
            
            23 And all the crowds were bewildered, and they said, “is this not the son of David?”
            <br><br>
            
            24 And the Prushim were listening {and the Purism/commentators rose up and heard} and they said, this [man] does not cast out demons except by Ba’al Zebub, {master} prince of the demons.”
            <br><br>
            
            25 And Yeshua knew their [very] thoughts, and he said to them {in a parable}, all kingdoms that are internally divided {amongst ye} will be devastated, and every city or house that is internally divided will not stand {will fall due to division in their midst, not made to stand}.
            
            <br><br>
            26 And if Satan casts out the Satan, he is divided within himself. Then how does his kingdom stand?
            
            <br><br>
            27 And me, if I cast out the demons by Ba’al Zebub, by whom [do] ye’s sons cast them out {ye’s sons, why can’t they cast them out [since they attempt to do the very thing you are accusing me of?]?. Therefore, they shall be your judges.
            <br><br>
            
            28 And if [it be] so that I cast out the demons by the Spirit of The Elohim, The Elohim’s Kingdom has come to ye.
            <br><br>
            
            29 And how is a man able to come into the soldier’s home to spoil his weapons if he won’t first tie up the soldier? And then he will spoil his house.
            <br><br>
            
            30 Whosoever that is not with me, he is against me, and whosoever does not gather with me will disperse.
            <br><br>
            
            31 Therefore I say to ye, all sin and blasphemy will be forgiven man, but blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven.
            <br><br>
            
            32 And every man that says a word against man it will be forgiven him, but whosoever speaks a word against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, not in this world or in the world to come.
            <br><br>
            ‫
            33 Produce a good tree and its fruit [will be] good, or else produce a bad tree, and its fruit [will be] bad, since by the fruits the tree is known.
            <br><br>
            
            34 Generation of vipers! How are ye able to speak good things when ye are evil? For from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
            <br><br>
            
            35 A good man in goodness brings forth good things from a good treasure, and an evil man brings forth evil things for an evil storehouse.
            <br><br>
            
            36 And I say to ye, that every useless word {all words} that men speak, they will render the reason for it {be bound to give account} on the judgment day {the day of the Court}
            <br><br>
            
            37 for by your words you will be [considered] righteous and by your words you will be charged.”</div>
