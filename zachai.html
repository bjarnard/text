   <p style="font-size: 150%;">
True repentence takes the will to do so. It takes faith and a strong belief that changing one's life--ceasing certain negative acts, and performing other new, postive ones--is the right thing to do.  This is especially true because this task won't be easy. But faith makes it easier to continue the effort. That's saving faith: the faith to recieve the holy commandment and keep it...the faith to live like Messiah! <br>
<br> 
Luke 19:1-10 recounts Yeshua's arrival in Jericho, where he stays a night with a man name Zakkai:          
<br><br>
"And having entered, He was passing through Yeriḥo.<br><br>
And see, a man called Zakkai! And he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich,
<br><br>
and he was seeking to see who יהושע was, but was unable because of the crowd, for he was small in stature.
<br><br>
And as יהושע came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, “Zakkai, hurry and come down, for I have to stay at your house today.”
<br><br>
And he hurried and came down, and received Him, rejoicing.
<br><br>
And seeing it, they all grumbled, saying, “He has gone in to stay with a man who is a sinner.”
  <br><br>
  But Zakkai stood up and said to the Master, “Look, Master, I give half of my possessions to the poor. And if I have taken whatever from anyone by false accusation, I repay fourfold.”
 <br><br>
 And יהושע said to him, “Today deliverance has come to this house – since he also is a son of Aḇraham.
 <br><br>
 “For the Son of Aḏam has come to seek and to save what was lost.”
 <br><br>
 
 Did you see how it was Zakkai's response to Yeshua that saved him? First of all, he did not initially know who Yeshua was. But he wanted to find out. Then he got the chance. But what prompted him to repent? 
<br><br>
In a simple sense, it seems to be that it was Yeshua himself. His very presence and authority inspired Zakkai to stand up (probably from a meal and/or sitting and listening to Yeshua) and make a public declaration he'd have to live up to. It seems Yeshua didn't have to say much, though he may have said much more than was recorded.   

 <br><br>
 The more nuanced answer might be that Zakkai heard deep wisdom from an authority that he would believe. Yeshua notes that it was his own coming that brought about the man's salvation, as in, "Today salvation has come to this house... for the son of Adam has come to seek and to save what was lost." Without Zakkai's faith in Yeshua's teachings, he would not have  made such a costly commitment based on the charisma of one healer from Galilee. Because he believed God's message brought by Yeshua, he was saved.
